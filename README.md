Question, does a flick mechanic in a rhythm game work on pc ? would it allow a rhythm game to be cross platform ?



Survey.
1- Do you have any rhythm game experiencce ? if yes, was it on pc, arcade or mobile ? if mobile, are you aware of flick notes ? 


2- did the flick notes feel intuitive in this prototype ? 





most players who had rhythm game experience understood the mechanic much faster than those who didn't. 
a lot of the players who didn't understand the mechanic asked for clarity, so maybe providing an example of the gameplay. 
some players suggested using a controller for this particular mechanic, others were interested in seeing it go further. 
some players wanted a better feedback for actually getting a successful hit in.
the players who understood the mechanic's origin/idea, felt like it was a very nice step away from the typical rhythm game.
